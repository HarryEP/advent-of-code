# advent-of-code

All of my advent of code solutions.

## Setup

For each day, you will need to create an "input.txt" file within the correct day's folder with the input you have been given for advent of code. It will be in a similar style to "sample.txt".

## How to run

For whichever day and part run (for day 1, part 1)

python3 day_1/part_1.py
